## bashscripting
I am trying to teach myself and other fellows some bash scripting fundamentals

### greeting-bash-0.sh
 The script you provided is a simple Bash script that interacts with the user by prompting them to enter their name and then greeting them.
### loop_bash.sh
In the loop-bash.sh: The script will always run, because we are using a loop. In other words:
"In this version of the script, the while loop runs indefinitely (while true), and the user is prompted to enter their name. If the user types "exit," the loop exits with the break command, and the script says goodbye. Otherwise, the script greets the user and continues to the next iteration of the loop. This way, the user can keep entering names and receiving greetings until they decide to exit the loop."
