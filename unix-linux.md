## Unix vs Linux
Unix:

Unix is an operating system family that was originally developed in the 1960s by AT&T's Bell Labs.
It is a proprietary operating system, and various versions of Unix were developed by different organizations, including AT&T, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and more.
Unix follows standards and specifications outlined in the Single UNIX Specification (SUS) or POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface), which define the behavior and functionality expected from Unix-like operating systems.
Examples of Unix-based operating systems include AIX (IBM), Solaris (formerly Sun Microsystems), and HP-UX (Hewlett-Packard).
Linux:

Linux is a Unix-like operating system kernel developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
It is open-source and freely available, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute its source code.
While Linux is a kernel, it is often paired with other components (such as the GNU userland utilities) to create complete operating systems known as Linux distributions or distros.
Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
So, in essence, both Unix and Linux are operating systems, but Unix refers to a family of operating systems that share certain standards and concepts, while Linux refers to a specific kernel that can be combined with other components to create Unix-like operating systems known as Linux distributions.




## Environmental Variable:
An environmental variable, such as the PATH variable, is a named value that holds information used by the operating system and programs to determine various aspects of their operation. The PATH variable specifically contains a list of directory paths where the shell (command-line interface) searches for executable files whenever a command is entered.

Purpose of the PATH Environment Variable:
The PATH environment variable is crucial for enabling users to run commands and programs from any location in the file system without specifying the full path to the executable file. When you enter a command in the terminal, the system searches through the directories listed in the PATH to locate the corresponding executable file and execute it. This allows for easy and convenient access to frequently used tools and applications.

Modifying the PATH Environment Variable:
To modify the PATH variable, you can use the export command. In the example you provided: export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory, you are appending a new directory (/new/directory) to the existing PATH value ($PATH). This ensures that the shell will also look for executable files in the newly added directory when you enter commands.

Environmental variables play a significant role in configuring and customizing the behavior of the Unix/Linux environment, and understanding how to manage them is essential for effective system usage and software development.




## Why Modifying the PATH Environment Variable:

 By modifying the PATH variable, you can add directories containing executable files to the list of locations where the shell searches for commands. This allows you to run programs and scripts from any directory without specifying their full paths, making it quicker and more convenient to use software.

Customizing System Behavior: Users often have their own set of preferred tools and applications. Modifying the PATH variable lets you prioritize the directories containing your preferred versions of programs. This customization ensures that when you run a command, your chosen executable is executed, regardless of the system-wide defaults.

Managing Multiple Software Versions: Many software packages have multiple versions installed on a system. Modifying the PATH allows you to switch between different versions of a program by changing the order of directories in the PATH. This is especially useful when working on projects that require specific software versions.

Development and Testing: Developers may want to test their code with specific versions of libraries or tools. Modifying the PATH allows them to point to the desired version during development and testing, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.

Avoiding Conflicts: Occasionally, systems might have different versions of the same program installed in various locations. By modifying the PATH, you can prioritize the version you intend to use, avoiding conflicts between different versions.

Installing Custom Software: When you install new software or libraries, they might be placed in a non-standard directory. Modifying the PATH lets you include these directories, ensuring that you can run the new software without needing to specify the full path each time.

Shell Scripting and Automation: When writing shell scripts or automation scripts, modifying the PATH can help ensure that the script uses the correct versions of programs and utilities.

Overall, modifying the PATH variable provides flexibility, customization, and control over the software and tools you use. It streamlines your workflow, reduces the need for typing lengthy paths, and ensures that the right versions of programs are accessible at all times.






## What is path?
The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories where the system looks for executable files. To modify it, use the export command, like: export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory. in this question, what is an environmental variable?
